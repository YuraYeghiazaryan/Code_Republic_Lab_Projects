# Lab-Projects
Welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I am a student at Picsart Academy and a member of Code Republic Lab. 
Here, you can find three small projects that I have worked on: 
Data Validator, Text Analyzer, and Zip.

Data Validator is a tool that allows you to validate and clean data by 
checking for missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues. 

Text Analyzer is a program that can analyze text and provide insights 
such as word count, sentence count, and most commonly used words. 

Finally, Zip is a utility that allows you to compress and decompress files with ease.
